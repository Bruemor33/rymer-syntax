# rymer-syntax theme

Just wanted to make a theme using some blues and green. Something to remind you of the colors of the ocean. I was inspired by the duo tone syntax themes but was sad that they had two dark of syntax punctuation. Look for more themes to come in the future.

Feel free to improve upon this theme in any way you see fit.
